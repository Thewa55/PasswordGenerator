# PasswordGenerator

Hello! Welcome to my password generator repository, this is my first project using fucntions and loops.
In this code you can generate the password based on four parameters - lower case letters, upper case letters, symbols, and numbers.
The upper and lower case letter all pull from the same array and the code's logic will compute if the letter will be a lower case, upper case or both!
If all four parameters are chosen, there is a 1/3 chance it will be a letter, number or symbol.
This code will generate a higher percentage of number and symbol then a code that uses only strings to represent the letters (upper and lower),symbols and numbers (Only true if everything is represented once - there are 52 strings of letters, 10 string of numbers and up to ~30 stings of symbols).
I hope you enjoy my code as much as I had fun coding it.
